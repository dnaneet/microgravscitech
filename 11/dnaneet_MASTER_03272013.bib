  title = {State of the Art of High Heat Flux Cooling Technologies},

  abstract = {The purpose of this literature review is to compare different cooling
	technologies currently in development in research laboratories that
	are competing to solve the challenge of cooling the next generation
	of high heat flux computer chips. Today, most development efforts
	are focused on three technologies: liquid cooling in copper or silicon
	micro-geometry heat dissipation elements, impingement of liquid jets
	directly on the silicon surface of the chip, and two-phase flow boiling
	in copper heat dissipation elements or plates with numerous microchannels.
	The principal challenge is to dissipate the high heat fluxes (current
	objective is 300 W/cm<sup>2</sup>) while maintaining the chip temperature
	below the targeted temperature of {85°C}, while of second importance
	is how to predict the heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops
	of the cooling process. In this study, the state of the art of these
	three technologies from recent experimental articles (since 2003)
	is analyzed and a comparison of the respective merits and drawbacks
	of each technology is presented. The conclusion is that two-phase
	flow boiling in microchannels is the most promising approach; impingement
	cooling also has good prospects but single-phase liquid cooling is
	probably only a short-term solution. As an example of the state of
	the first technology, the Heat and Mass Transfer Laboratory at Ecole
	Polytechnique F\'{e}d\'{e}rale de Lausanne has already achieved 200
	W/cm<sup>2</sup> of cooling in a first prototype, with a low pumping
	power, good temperature uniformity, and at the required maximal operating
	temperature.},

  title = {Spreading of thin volatile liquid droplets on uniformly heated surfaces},
  journal = {Journal of Fluid Mechanics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {528},
  pages = {279--296},
  abstract = {We develop a mathematical model for the spreading of a thin volatile
	liquid droplet on a uniformly heated surface. The model accounts
	for the effects of surface tension, evaporation, thermocapillarity,
	gravity and disjoining pressure for both perfectly wetting and partially
	wetting liquids. Previous studies of non-isothermal spreading did
	not include the effects of disjoining pressure and therefore had
	to address the difficult issue of imposing proper boundary conditions
	at the contact line where the droplet surface touches the heated
	substrate. We avoid this difficulty by taking advantage of the fact
	that dry areas on the heated solid surface are typically covered
	by a microscopic adsorbed film where the disjoining pressure suppresses
	evaporation. We use a lubrication-type approach to derive a single
	partial differential equation capable of describing both the time-dependent
	macroscopic shape of the droplet and the microscopic adsorbed film;
	the contact line is then defined as the transition region between
	the two. In the framework of this model we find that both evaporation
	and thermocapillary stresses act to prevent surface-tension-driven
	spreading. Apparent contact angle, defined by the maximum interfacial
	slope in the contact-line region, decays in time as a droplet evaporates,
	but the rate of decay is different from that predicted in earlier
	studies of evaporating droplets. We attribute the difference to nonlinear
	coupling between different physical effects contributing to the value
	of the contact angle; previous studies used a linear superposition
	of these effects. We also discuss comparison of our results with
	experimental data available in the literature.},

	angle for gravity-driven flow of a volatile liquid down a heated
	inclined plane. The apparent contact line is modeled as the transition
	region between the macroscopic film and ultra-thin adsorbed film
	dominated by disjoining pressure effects. Four commonly used disjoining
	pressure models are investigated. The static contact angle is shown
	to increase with heater temperature, in qualitative agreement with
	experimental observations. The angle is less sensitive to the details
	of the disjoining pressure curves than in the isothermal regime.
	A generalization of the classical {Frumkin–Derjaguin} theory is proposed
	to explain this observation. The dynamic contact angle follows the
	Tanner's law remarkably well over a range of evaporation conditions.
	However, deviations from the predictions based on the Tanner's law
	are found when interface shape changes rapidly in response to rapid
	changes of the heater temperature. The Marangoni stresses are shown
	to result in increase of the values of apparent contact angles. We

	multiple solutions to hydrodynamic problems, especially questions
	about bifurcations of solutions and about stability. Although the
	aim is to resolve some of these questions generally, particular reference
	is made to events observed in the Taylor experiment on Couette flow
	between rotating cylinders, for which a new rationale is developed.
	In {\S}2 certain results for the abstract nonlinear problem of steady
	motion in a bounded fluid are summarized, including a set of generic
	properties that can be associated with real flows. In {\S}3 these
	results are applied to the interpretation of observable phenomena,
	and several predictions are made which are open to experimental checks.
	It is shown that new insights into the Taylor experiment are gained
	by considering its dependence on two parameters, one the Reynolds
	number R and the other the length l of the flow domain. Attention
	is paid to the initial development of cells as R is gradually increased
	from small values ({\S}3.3), to a hysteresis phenomenon accompanying
	morphogenesis of the cellular structure at critical values of l ({\S}3.4),
	and to properties of secondary modes possible above respective critical
	values of R ({\S}3.5). In the appendix some corresponding interpretations

	both in the presence and absence of surface contamination, which
	was shown to exert a considerable influence on the convective flow.
	It was found that, with the exception of water, the observed flow
	structures were largely dependent on the depth of the evaporating
	pool and to a much lesser extent on the properties of the liquid.
	Also, it was possible to identify certain flow patterns as being
	induced by a surface-tension-driven instability and others as being
	due to buoyancy-driven convection; still other patterns seemed to
	be uniquely associated with the presence of surface contamination.},

	liquid is heated from the bottom wall and cooled from above. The

	ratio between gravity and thermocapillary force. The other is the
	static Bond number, which describes the ratio between gravity and

	full-scale direct numerical simulations of the long-wavelength Marangoni
	instability in two dimensions. The time evolution of the free surface
	leads to the formation of drained regions (so-called ``dry spots'').
	The simulations demonstrate a remarkable complexity of the touchdown
	process, involving a deep cascade from large to increasingly small
	structures. In the behavior of the minimum height of the interface
	hmin at large time simple scaling dependence on time was not observed.
	Extrapolation of hmin exhibits infinite-time singularity. The dependence

  abstract = {We consider the dynamics of a thin symmetric fluid sheet subject to

	We apply a long-wave analysis in the limit where deviations from
	the mean sheet velocity are small, but thermocapillary stresses and
	heat transfer from the sheet to the environment are significant and
	find a coupled system of partial differential equations that describe
	the sheet thickness, the mean sheet velocity, and the mean sheet
	temperature. From a linear stability analysis, we find that a stable
	thermal mode couples the velocity to the interfacial dynamics. This
	coupling can be utilized to delay the onset of rupture or to promote
	an earlier rupture event. In particular, rupture can be induced thermally
	even in cases when the heat transfer to the surrounding environment
	is significant, provided that the initial phase shift between the
	initial velocity and temperature disturbances is close to ϕ = π/2.
	These effects suggest a strategy that uses phase modulation in the

	perturbation that assigns priority of the rupture events at particular

	Nerpin and Churaev demonstrated that isothermal liquid flow in a
	very thin film on the walls of a capillary tube enhances the rate
	of evaporation of moisture by several times. The objective of this
	review is to present the evolution of the use of Churaev's seminal
	research in the development of the Constrained Vapor Bubble ({CVB})
	heat transfer system. In this non-isothermal ” wickless heat pipe”,
	liquid and vapor flow results from gradients in the intermolecular
	force field, which depend on the disjoining pressure, capillarity
	and temperature. A {Kelvin–Clapeyron} model allowed the use of the
	disjoining pressure to be expanded to describe non-isothermal heat,
	mass and momentum transport processes. The intermolecular force field
	described by the convenient disjoining pressure model is the boundary
	condition for ” suction” and stability at the leading edge of the
	evaporating curved flow field. As demonstrated by the non-isothermal
	results, applications that depend on the characteristics of the evaporating

  abstract = {We examine the effects of thick (micron scale) fluid films and thin
	molecular scale (10–100 \r{A}) films on the hydrodynamics near advancing
	contact lines by measuring the liquid–vapor interface shape of a
	meniscus and comparing the measurements to three models. Using flow
	visualization, we directly observe the fluid flow field near the
	moving contact line and give a qualitative description of the stagnation
	point and dividing streamline emanating from the contact line region.
	For thick films, when the capillary number satisfies Ca(a/d)3/2 ⩽
	O(1) (where d is the film thickness and a is the macroscopic length
	scale of the system), the liquid–vapor interface is bent only slightly
	by the viscous flow and the effective dynamic contact angle is close
	to zero. As Ca approaches O(1/ln(a/d)), a modulated wedge-like region
	appears at some distance from the film and expands both away from
	and toward the film as Ca increases. The dynamic contact angle approaches
	the classic power law behavior as this region expands. For molecularly
	thin films, the liquid–vapor interface shape within microns of the
	moving contact line is correctly described by theoretical models
	based purely on hydrodynamics and without disjoining pressure effects.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Energy stability theory has been formulated for two-dimensional
	buoyancy\&ndash;thermocapillary convection in a layer with a free

	R \&lt; RE is a sufficient condition for stability of the layer.
	RE emerges from the variational formulation as an eigenvalue of a
	nonlinear system of Euler\&ndash;Lagrange equations. For the case
	of small capillary number (large mean surface tension) explicit values
	are obtained for RE. The analogous linear-theory results for this
	case are obtained in terms of a critical Rayleigh number RL. These
	are compared. It is found that the existence of the deformable interface
	can lead to a stabilization relative to the case of a planar interface.
	This result is explained in physical terms. The energy theory is
	then generalized to include general flow problems having three-dimensional
	disturbances, non-Newtonian bulk fluids and general interfacial mechanics
	such as surface viscosity and elasticity.},

	under tension, is of great interest both in condensed matter science
	as well as in diverse applications such as botany, hydraulic engineering,
	and medicine. Although widely studied in bulk and microscale-confined
	liquids, cavitation in the nanoscale is generally believed to be
	energetically unfavorable and has never been experimentally demonstrated.
	Here we report evaporation-induced cavitation in water-filled hydrophilic
	nanochannels under enormous negative pressures up to -7 {MPa}. As
	opposed to receding menisci observed in microchannel evaporation,
	the menisci in nanochannels are pinned at the entrance while vapor
	bubbles form and expand inside. Evaporation in the channels is found
	to be aided by advective liquid transport, which leads to an evaporation
	rate that is an order of magnitude higher than that governed by Fickian
	vapor diffusion in macro- and microscale evaporation. The vapor bubbles
	also exhibit unusual motion as well as translational stability and
	symmetry, which occur because of a balance between two competing
	mass fluxes driven by thermocapillarity and evaporation. Our studies

  abstract = {Surface-tension-driven flows and, in particular, their tendency to
	decay spontaneously into drops have long fascinated naturalists,
	the earliest systematic experiments dating back to the beginning
	of the 19th century. Linear stability theory governs the onset of
	breakup and was developed by Rayleigh, Plateau, and Maxwell. However,
	only recently has attention turned to the nonlinear behavior in the
	vicinity of the singular point where a drop separates. The increased
	attention is due to a number of recent and increasingly refined experiments,
	as well as to a host of technological applications, ranging from
	printing to mixing and fiber spinning. The description of drop separation
	becomes possible because jet motion turns out to be effectively governed
	by one-dimensional equations, which still contain most of the richness
	of the original dynamics. In addition, an attraction for physicists
	lies in the fact that the separation singularity is governed by universal
	scaling laws, which constitute an asymptotic solution of the {Navier-Stokes}
	equation before and after breakup. The {Navier-Stokes} equation is
	thus continued uniquely through the singularity. At high viscosities,
	a series of noise-driven instabilities has been observed, which are
	a nested superposition of singularities of the same universal form.
	At low viscosities, there is rich scaling behavior in addition to
	aesthetically pleasing breakup patterns driven by capillary waves.
	The author reviews the theoretical development of this field alongside
	recent experimental work, and outlines unsolved problems.},

	interest to both industrial and academic communities. Compositional
	changes that occur during the drying process make the implementation
	of practical and efficient numerical models rather difficult. In
	this paper we present a three-dimensional mathematical and numerical
	model based on the lubrication approximation for the flow of drying
	paint films on horizontal substrates. The paint is modeled as a multicomponent
	liquid with one nonvolatile and one volatile component, termed the
	?resin? and the ?solvent? respectively. Our model includes the effects
	of surface tension and gravitational forces as well as surface tension
	gradient effects which arise due to solvent evaporation. The dependence
	of viscosity, diffusivity, and evaporation rate on resin concentration
	is also incorporated in the model. A closed-form linearized solution
	has been found for coating layers that are of almost uniform thickness.
	The numerical solution agrees closely with the linear solution in
	the appropriate limit. A model simulation demonstrates the effect
	of surface tension gradients due to compositional changes in a three-dimensional
	flow field, and we suggest methods by which these gradients may be
	used to obtain a more uniform final coating layer.},

	effect on the amount of sunlight reflected back to space, with important
	implications for the Earth's climate. These cloud patterns can be
	observed in satellite images of the Earth and often exhibit distinct
	cell-like structures associated with organized convection at scales
	of tens of kilometres1, 2, 3. Recent evidence has shown that atmospheric
	aerosol particles?through their influence on precipitation formation?help
	to determine whether cloud fields take on closed (more reflective)
	or open (less reflective) cellular patterns4, 5. The physical mechanisms
	controlling the formation and evolution of these cells, however,
	are still poorly understood6, limiting our ability to simulate realistically
	the effects of clouds on global reflectance. Here we use satellite
	imagery and numerical models to show how precipitating clouds produce
	an open cellular cloud pattern that oscillates between different,
	weakly stable states. The oscillations are a result of precipitation
	causing downward motion and outflow from clouds that were previously
	positively buoyant. The evaporating precipitation drives air down
	to the Earth's surface, where it diverges and collides with the outflows
	of neighbouring precipitating cells. These colliding outflows form
	surface convergence zones and new cloud formation. In turn, the newly
	formed clouds produce precipitation and new colliding outflow patterns
	that are displaced from the previous ones. As successive cycles of
	this kind unfold, convergence zones alternate with divergence zones
	and new cloud patterns emerge to replace old ones. The result is
	an oscillating, self-organized system with a characteristic cell
	size and precipitation frequency.}},

	occurs when the layer is sufficiently thin. For larger temperature
	differences, thin and thick layers are unstable, while layers of
	moderate depth are stable. When the temperature difference is beyond
	a certain value, there is no depth that will render the layer stable.

  abstract = {An evaporation model compatible with interface-capturing schemes for
	vapor–liquid flow is presented. The model formulation is largely
	independent of the specific realization of interface-capturing and
	relies on a continuum-field representation of the source terms implementable
	in a broad class of {CFD} models. In contrast to most other numerical
	methods for evaporating interfacial flows, the model incorporates
	an evaporation source-term derived from a physical relationship for
	the evaporation mass flux. It is shown that especially for microscale
	evaporation phenomena this implies significant deviations of the
	interface temperature from the saturation temperature. The mass source-term
	distribution is derived from the solution of an inhomogeneous Helmholtz
	equation that contains a free parameter allowing to tune the spatial
	localization of the source. The evaporation model is implemented
	into the volume-of-fluid scheme with piecewise linear interface construction.
	Results are obtained for three analytically or semi-analytically
	solvable model problems, the first two being one-dimensional Stefan
	problems, the third a free droplet evaporation problem. In addition,
	a two-dimensional film boiling problem is considered. Overall, the
	comparison between the {CFD} and the (semi)-analytical models shows
	good agreement. Deviations exist where convective heat transfer due
	to spurious currents is no longer negligible compared to heat conduction.
	With regard to the film boiling problem, a similar evaporation pattern
	as recently identified using a level-set method is found. A major
	advantage of the developed evaporation model is that it does not
	refer to intrinsic details of the interface-capturing scheme, but
	relies on continuum-field quantities that can be computed by virtually
	any {CFD} approach.},

	transfer of liquid hydrogen in a cryogenic storage tank with a heat
	pipe and an array of pump-nozzle units. A forced flow is directed
	onto the evaporator section of the heat pipe to prevent the liquid
	from boiling off when heat leaks through the tank wall insulation
	from the surroundings. An axisymmetric computational model was developed
	for the simulation of convective heat transfer in the system. Steady-state
	velocity and temperature fields were solved from this model by using
	the finite element method. Forty five configurations of geometry
	and velocity were considered. As the nozzle fluid speed increases,
	the values of the maximum, average, and spatial standard deviation
	of the temperature field decrease nonlinearly. Parametric analysis
	indicates that overall thermal performance of the system can be significantly
	improved by reducing the gap between the nozzle and the heat pipe,
	while maintaining the same fluid speed exiting the nozzle. It is
	also indicated that increased inlet tube length of the pump-nozzle
	unit results in slightly better thermal performance. Increased heat
	pipe length also improves thermal performance but only for low fluid
	speed. \^{a}º Cryogenic storage of liquid hydrogen with zero boil-off.

  abstract = {Many industrial processes involve the coating of substrates with thin
	layers of paint. This paper is concerned with modelling the variations
	in layer thickness which may occur as a paint layer dries. Firstly,
	a systematic derivation is provided of a model based on classical
	lubrication theory for a drying paint layer consisting of a non-volatile
	resin and a volatile solvent. The effects of variable surface tension,
	viscosity, solvent diffusivity and solvent evaporation rate are all
	included in the model. This analysis makes explicit the validity
	of the physically intuitive approximations made by earlier authors
	and hence clarifies when the model is appropriate. Secondly, the
	model is used to analyse the evolution of small perturbations to
	the thickness of, and the concentration of solvent in, a drying paint
	layer. This analysis provides an analytical description of the 'reversal'
	of an initial perturbation to the thickness of the layer and the
	appearance of a perturbation to an initially flat layer caused by
	an initial perturbation to the concentration of solvent. Thirdly,
	it is shown how a simplified version of the model applicable to the
	case of surface-tension-gradient-dominated flow can be derived and
	solved as an initial-value problem. Fourthly, the applicability of
	the present theory developed for solvent-based high-gloss alkyd paints
	to waterborne coatings is discussed. Finally, the results obtained
	are summarised and the practical implications of the work are discussed.},

	in turn, the important boundary properties and make predictions of
	the properties necessary for successful control experiments. A surprising

	These results indicate that the gravity-gradient acceleration is

	the eccentric contour of a bubble revolving around the axis of a
	Dewar in a horizontal r-theta plane. As the viscous force across

	slosh-wave excitation, installing baffles in the rotating Dewar is
	expected to dampen these waves. Results show that the damping effect
	provided by a baffle reduces the amplitude of slosh-wave excitation
	and lowers the degree of asymmetry in the liquid-vapor distribution.
	Computation of bubble (helium vapor) mass-center fluctuations also
	verifies that rotating a Dewar with baffles installed produces less

	into colloidal suspensions, we can systematically decrease the amount

	concentration. Since the emulsion droplets eventually also evaporate,
	our technique achieves an effective function while making little
	changes to the component of final product, and may therefore serve
	as a promising approach for cracking elimination. Furthermore, adding
	droplets also varies the speed of air invasion and provides a powerful

  abstract = {Laser confocal microscopy is used to non-invasively investigate the
	steady and unsteady evolution of viscous microdroplets on solid substrates.
	Three characteristic dynamical regimes of spreading drops (viscous-capillary,
	viscous-inertia-capillary, and inertia-capillary) are studied using
	this non-invasive optical technique. It is shown that the dynamics
	of each regime depend on the Ohnesorge number, Oh=[mu]/([rho]R[sigma])1/2,
	and on the relative magnitudes of the droplet height, radius, compared
	with the capillary length, . The power-law relationships between
	the extent of spreading and elapsed time that are extracted from
	the experiments are in excellent agreement with available analytical
	results. We also study the onset and evolution of surface instabilities
	of the slightly volatile liquid films as they spread across the thermally-conductive
	surfaces. When the fluid droplet is a volatile silicone oil and the
	surface is a smooth silicon wafer, an evaporatively-driven thermocapillary
	instability leads to onset of a time-dependent free surface motion.
	Below a certain critical thickness (\~{}20 [mu]m), waves can be observed
	on the free surface of the film, and the confocal technique is used
	to measure the amplitude, the frequency, and non-linear evolution
	of these waves. We interpret these waves in terms of evaporatively-driven
	Marangoni instabilities induced by surface tension gradients close
	to the moving contact line. Experiments show that the amplitude and
	the critical onset thickness of the disturbances vary with the viscosity
	and the volatility of the liquid, and also with the surface roughness
	and thermal diffusivity of the substrate. The critical onset conditions
	for this evaporatively driven instability can be characterized by
	a dimensionless interfacial thermal resistance, , which has to be
	larger than a critical value at the onset of instability. We also
	demonstrate that this evaporatively-driven Marangoni instability
	can be eliminated by reducing the volatility of the liquid or the
	thermal diffusivity of the substrate.},

  abstract = {Introducing of additional terms into the balance equations to specify
	the conditions at the interface allows to study physical phenomena
	in the diffusion evaporation (condensation) of the liquid into the
	neutral gas. We have taken into account the vapour dynamic effects
	on evaporating liquid, as well as the waste of energy on deformation
	of the boundary, changing of the interfacial temperature (the interface
	has an internal energy and therefore heat capacity), to overcome
	the surface tension etc. This paper presents the balance conditions
	at the interface with the diffusion evaporation of the liquid into
	the neutral gas, for the case when the vapour is considered as an
	impurity in the gas phase. The analysis of the dimensionless criteria
	is carried out. The areas of parameters for which the effect of some
	physical factors take a place have been defined. The exact solution
	of the diffusion evaporation for a spherical drop at zero gravity
	conditions has been constructed. The explicit expression for the
	interfacial temperature and evaporation rate were derived. Solution
	for evaporation rate coincides with the solution obtained by Maxwell
	( 1890 ).},

	depend on their frequency and amplitude. Larger pulses travel faster;
	this property, plus a strong inelasticity, causes larger pulses to

	behind. These wave interactions lead to the production of solitary
	wave trains from periodic small amplitude waves. The spacings between
	solitary waves can be irregular for several different reasons, including
	the amplification of ambient noise, and the interaction process itself.
	On the other hand, this irregularity is suppressed by the addition

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic cavitation in flows through a micro-orifice entrenched
	in a microchannel has been detected and experimentally investigated.
	Microfabrication techniques have been employed to design and develop
	a microfluidic device containing an 11.5 μm wide micro-orifice inside
	a 100.2 μm wide and 101.3 μm deep microchannel. The flow of de-ionized
	water through the micro-orifice reveals the presence of multifarious
	cavitating flow regimes. This investigation divulges both similarities
	and differences between cavitation in micro-orifices and cavitation
	in their macroscale counterparts. The low incipient cavitation number
	obtained from the current experiments suggests a dominant size scale
	effect. Choking cavitation is observed to be independent of any pressure
	or velocity scale effects. However, choking is significantly influenced
	by the small stream nuclei residence time at such scales. Flow rate
	choking leads to the establishment of a stationary cavity. Large
	flow and cavitation hysteresis have been detected at the microscale
	leading to very high desinent cavitation numbers. The rapid transition
	from incipient bubbles to choking cavitation and subsequent supercavitation
	suggests the presence of radically different flow patterns at the
	microscale. Supercavitation results in a thick cavity, which extends
	throughout the microchannel, and is encompassed by the liquid. Cavitation
	at the microscale is expected to considerably influence the design
	of innovative high-speed microfluidic systems.},

  abstract = {We present the results of an experimental study of convective instabilities
	in a horizontal liquid layer with free upper surface under the action
	of an inclined temperature gradient, i.e., when horizontal and vertical
	temperature gradients are applied at the same time. Silicone oil
	of 10 {cSt} (Prandtl number Pr = 102) was employed as the test fluid.
	We investigated the layers with different thicknesses to examine
	the influence of gravity on the formation of the convective patterns.
	It is found out that the system behavior appreciably depends on the
	dynamic Bond number, which shows a relation of buoyancy and thermocapillary
	forces. In the case of small dynamic Bond numbers, when the influence
	of buoyancy is minimal, four different flow patterns, according to
	the combination of the vertical and horizontal Marangoni numbers,
	have been found: steady parallel flow, {B\'{e}nard–Marangoni} cells,
	drifting {B\'{e}nard–Marangoni} cells, and longitudinal rolls. At
	larger dynamic Bond number, when the influence of buoyancy becomes
	considerable, new convective structures, named by us the ” surface
	longitudinal rolls” and the ” surface drifting cells,” appear in
	addition to the patterns listed above. These instabilities exist
	only in the surface part of the thermocapillary flow, whereas the
	return flow remains stable. Under large enough dynamic Bond number
	these patterns become the dominating ones, forcing out the classical
	{B\'{e}nard–Marangoni} instability. We give a phenomenological description
	of the obtained convective patterns and present the stability diagram
	in the plane of the vertical and the horizontal Marangoni numbers.},

  abstract = {This paper is a review of work on thin fluid films where surface tension
	is a driving mechanism. Its aim is to highlight the substantial amount
	of literature dealing with relevant physical models and also analytic
	work on the resultant equations. In general the introduction of surface
	tension into standard lubrication theory leads to a fourth-order
	nonlinear parabolic equation ? h/? t + ?/? x(Ch3/3?3h/? x3 + f(h,hx,hxx))
	= 0, where h = h(x,t) is the fluid film height. For steady situations
	this equation may be integrated once and a third-order ordinary differential
	equation is obtained. Appropriate forms of this equation have been
	used to model fluid flows in physical situations such as coating,
	draining of foams, and the movement of contact lenses. In the introduction
	a form of the above equation is derived for flow driven by surface
	tension, surface tension gradients, gravity, and long range molecular
	forces. Modifications to the equation due to slip, the effect of
	two free surfaces, two phase fluids, and higher dimensional forms
	are also discussed. The second section of this paper describes physical
	situations where surface tension driven lubrication models apply
	and the governing equations are given. The third section reviews
	analytical work on the model equations as well as the "generalized
	lubrication equation" ? h/? t + ?/? x(hnh xxx) = 0. In particular
	the discussion focusses on asymptotic results, travelling waves,
	stability, and similarity solutions. Numerical work is also discussed,
	while for analytical results the reader is directed to existing literature.},

	an ideal plane interface (molecularly clean and smooth). The model
	is used for both volatile and nonvolatile isothermal liquid films.
	It is shown that in the nonvolatile case the evolution results in
	the emergence of static steady states consisting of liquid ridges
	separated by very thin films. A supercritical bifurcation from the
	trivial state is shown to be possible in the presence of repulsive
	forces, while in the presence of only attractive forces the bifurcation
	is subcritical. In the evaporative case the long-time evolution of
	the film is shown to lead to its flattening and then to its apparent
	vanishing. Several scenarios for the film disappearance are found.
	A relationship between the rate of expansion of the dry spot and
	the apparent contact angle is examined. The effect of thermocapillarity
	on the film evolution is also considered.},

  abstract = {This paper uses thin-film asymptotics to show how a thin vapour layer
	can support a liquid which is heated from below and cooled from above,
	a process known as horizontal film boiling. This approach leads to
	a single, strongly-nonlinear evolution equation which incorporates
	buoyancy, capillary and evaporative effects. The stability of the
	vapour layer is analysed using a variety of methods for both saturated
	and subcooled film boiling. In subcooled film boiling, there is a
	stationary solution, a constant-thickness vapour film, which is determined
	by a simple heat-conduction balance. This is {RayleighTaylor} unstable
	because the heavier liquid is above the vapour, but the instability
	is completely suppressed for sufficient subcooling. A bifurcation
	analysis determines a supercritical branch of stable, spatially-periodic
	solutions when the basic state is no longer stable. Numerical branch
	tracing extends this into the strongly-nonlinear regime, revealing
	a hysteresis loop and a secondary bifurcation to a branch of travelling
	waves which are stable under certain conditions. There are no stationary
	solutions in saturated film boiling, but the initial development
	of vapour bubbles is determined by directly solving the time-dependent
	evolution equation. This yields important information about the transient
	heat transfer during bubble development.},

	are discretized using a Galerkin finite-element method with implicit

	heating, vapour heating and uniform heating. For each case, the pressure

	in the liquid are determined. Results are compared to a lumped thermodynamic
	model of the entire tank. It is shown that the final rate of pressure
	rise is about the same in each case and close to that predicted by
	thermodynamics even though the actual pressures are different because
	of varying degrees of thermal stratification. Finally, a subcooled
	liquid jet is used to mix the liquid and limit the pressure rise.
	Even so, there is still some thermal stratification in the liquid,

  abstract = {ABSTRACT A mechanism is proposed by which cellular convective motion
	of the type observed by H. B\&eacute;nard, which hitherto has been
	attributed to the action of buoyancy forces, can also be induced
	by surface tension forces. Thus when a thin layer of fluid is heated
	from below, the temperature gradient is such that small variations
	in the surface temperature lead to surface tractions which cause
	the fluid to flow and thereby tend to maintain the original temperature
	variations. A small disturbance analysis, analogous to that carried
	out by Rayleigh and others for unstable density gradients, leads
	to a dimensionless number B which expresses the ratio of surface
	tension to viscous forces, and which must attain a certain minimum
	critical value for instability to occur. The results obtained are
	then applied to the original cells described by B\&eacute;nard, and
	to the case of drying paint films. It is concluded that surface tension
	forces are responsible for cellular motion in many such cases where
	the criteria given in terms of buoyancy forces would not allow of
	instability.},

	evaporation in vacuum using heat transfer relations. An experimental
	device was designed. experimental set-up which was used was equipped
	with a triangular weir distribution device and it had the ability
	to record data up to 3 m. Experiments were performed in a single-effect
	process with sucrose–water solution varying from 3 to 20\% concentration
	rate of sucrose and we used a vertical tube evaporator with the dimensions
	of laboratory scale. The model that was developed considers convection,
	shear stress, viscosity and conjugate heat transfer while most of
	the previous works ignored these factors. The main factors influencing
	the heat transfer mechanism performance of the unit were investigated
	and analyzed. We concluded that the experimental studies are verified
	by the developed model. Furthermore, it was also concluded that,
	the heat transfer is affected by the mass flow rate, sucrose concentration
	rate in solution, film thickness and pressure.},

	in which the temperature decreases with uniform gradient between
	a lower horizontal surface which is heated and an upper horizontal
	surface which is cooled. The problem has been treated both experimentally
	and theoretically by Benard, Brunt, Jeffreys, Low and Rayleigh, and
	it is known that instability will occur at some critical value of
	the Rayleigh Number , h denoting the thickness of the fluid layer,
	fractional excess of density the fractional excess of density in
	the fluid at the top as compared with the fluid at the bottom surface,
	k the diffusivity and nu the kinematic viscosity. The critical value
	depends upon the conditions at the top and bottom surfaces, which
	may be either 'free' or constrained by rigid conducting surfaces.
	The theoretical problem is solved here under three distinct boundary
	conditions, and greater generality than before is maintained in regard
	to the 'cell pattern' which occurs in plan. In addition an approximate
	method is described and illustrated, depending on a stationary property
	akin to that of which Lord Rayleigh made wide application in vibration
	theory. Within the assumptions of the approximate theory (i.e. with
	neglect of terms of the second order in respect of the velocities)
	a particular size is associated with every shape of cell (such that
	'a2' takes a preferred value), but no particular shape is more likely
	than another to occur in a layer of indefinite extent (section 31).
	The explanation of the apparent preference for a hexagonal cell pattern
	(section 5) must presumably be sought in a theory which takes account
	of second-order terms. This conjecture if correct goes some way towards
	explaining the rather indefinite nature of observed cell-formations
	(cf. Low 1930, figure 10).},

  abstract = {Evaporation of droplets or liquid films lying on a substrate induces
	internal viscous flow, which affects the transport of suspended particles
	and, thus, the final deposit profile in numerous applications. In
	this work, the problem of Stokes flow inside a two-dimensional droplet,
	representing the cross section of an evaporating liquid line lying
	on a flat surface, is considered. The stream function formulation
	is adopted, leading to the biharmonic equation in bipolar coordinates.
	A solution in closed form is obtained for any contact angle in (0,π)
	and is, thus, valid for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates.
	The solution can be used with any type of evaporation mechanism,
	including diffusion, convection, or kinetically controlled modes.
	Both pinned and depinned contact lines are considered. For the boundary
	conditions to be compatible at the contact lines, the Navier slip
	boundary condition is applied on the substrate. Numerical results
	are presented for kinetically and diffusion controlled evaporation.
	For pinned contact lines, the flow inside the evaporating liquid
	line is directed towards the edges, thus, promoting the coffee stain
	phenomenon. In the case of depinned contact lines and contact angle
	less than π∕2, the flow is directed towards the center of the droplet,
	whereas, for strongly hydrophobic substrates it is directed outwards.},

	and the magnitude of a possible velocity overshoot have been adjusted
	by changing the contact angle between the liquid and the side wall.
	The influence of the contact angle on the stability of the flow,
	and especially its range, is remarkable. The difference of the neutral
	stability curves for the two investigated contact angles is up to
	25\% and remains significant even up to a side wall distance of 17
	times the capillary length. Irrespective of the contact angle, the
	type of the free surface instability undergoes a transition from
	long-wave in the center of the channel to short-wave, as is well

  abstract = {Nearly all mathematical models which are commonly used to predict
	the dispersion of chimney gases in the atmosphere or heated water
	discharges in the aquatic environment employ the so-called Boussinesq
	approximation. It is part of this approximation that density variations
	appear solely in the buoyancy term of the momentum equation and are
	neglected in all other terms.The exact limits of validity of the
	Boussinesq approximation and the precise effects the simplifications
	have on model performance are known only qualitatively.The objective
	of this paper is to present, for a variety of industrial stack plumes
	with different initial density ratios, comparisons of predictions
	which have been obtained employing 1) a model which makes the Boussinesq
	approximation and 2) a version of the same model in which this approximation
	has not been introduced. It was found that the difference in jet-property
	predictions between the two models increases with increasing initial
	density defect ratio. In the case of the largest ratio tested (/=
	0.5), the maximum height of rise predicted with the Boussinesq approximated
	model was 20\% larger than predicted with the non-Boussinesq approximated
	model. These differences in predictions are, of course, to some extent
	model-specific but provide, nevertheless, a first quantitative estimate
	on how the Boussinesq approximation affects the performance of plume
	models.},

	was found to correlate with the lamella number, an indicator of the
	forces favouring oil emulsification and imbibition into foams in
	porous media. Among three crude oils, foam stability in the presence
	of oil decreased as the ” heaviness” of the crude oil decreased.
	Since the oil sensitivity of foams can be described in terms of surface
	properties, the present results can be used to set foam-oil stability

  abstract = {Failure of a liquid coating to remain continuous on a substrate that
	exhibits a significant equilibrium contact angle is a common occurrence
	in industrial applications. The term \#reticulation\# is sometimes
	used to describe the resulting formation of a pattern of defects.
	The failure may take the form of coating perforations and dewetting,
	and it may ultimately lead to a set of isolated drops. We present
	mathematical and experimental results for reticulation. The theoretical
	and numerical results use a disjoining-conjoining pressure model
	to represent the substrate energetics. The theory uses the small-slope
	or \#lubrication\# approximation and also includes the effects of
	evaporation and drying of the coating. The model employs a two-component
	liquid where the viscosity depends on local values of the nonvolatile
	mixture fraction. A linear analysis for a slightly perturbed uniform
	layer predicts a most-unstable wavelength and an associated growth
	rate. These are in approximate agreement with the modeling results.
	Computations employing the full nonlinear model show the wide variety
	of patterns that can arise in the drying liquid. These patterns are
	both qualitatively and quantitatively similar to actual patterns
	that we observe experimentally. Small defects that are visible in
	the experiment are used to initiate reticulation in the numerical
	simulation.},

  abstract = {We present the linear stability of the laminar flow of an immiscible
	system of a compressible gas and incompressible liquid separated
	by an interface with large surface tension in a thin inclined channel.
	The flow is driven by an applied pressure drop and gravity. Following
	the air–water case, which is found in a variety of engineering systems,
	the ratio of the characteristic values of the gas and liquid densities
	and viscosities are assumed to be disparate. Under the lubrication
	approximation, and assuming ideal gas behaviour and isothermal conditions,
	this approach leads to a coupled non-linear system of partial differential
	equations describing the evolution of the interface between the gas
	and the liquid and the streamwise density distribution of the gas.
	This system also includes the effects of viscosity stratification,
	inertia, shear and capillarity. A linear stability analysis that
	allows for physically relevant non-zero pressure-drop base state
	is then performed. In contrast to the zero-pressure drop case which
	is amenable to the classical normal-mode approach, this configuration
	requires numerically solving a boundary-value problem for the gas
	density and interfacial deviations from the base state in the streamwise
	coordinate. We find that the effect of the gas compressibility on
	the interfacial stability in the limit of vanishingly small wavenumber
	is destabilizing, even for Stokes flow in the liquid. However, for
	finite wavenumber disturbances, compressibility may have stabilizing
	effects. In this regime, sufficient shear is required to destabilize
	the flow.},

  __markedentry = {[aneet84]},
  abstract = {A formalism is developed to investigate the instability and the time
	of rupture of thin films which are subjected to finite amplitude
	perturbations. The hydrodynamic and the interaction force nonlinearities
	cannot be ignored in such an event. The key idea of the approach
	is that, for a finite amplitude perturbation, one needs to study
	the instability of the corresponding finite amplitude, spatially
	nonhomogeneous stationary solution of the governing equations. It
	is in the event of infinitesimal perturbations that the nonhomogeneous
	stationary state reduces to the planar interface, the stability issue
	of which is addressed by the linear stability analysis. Thus the
	essential idea is to account for a part of the finite disturbance
	of the interface in the base state itself, thereby facilitating the
	solution for a finite amplitude disturbance. This procedure brings
	the base state (or the zeroth order solution) closer to the initial
	perturbation, in contrast to the choice of the base state as an undisturbed,
	planar interface. The formalism gives the growth rate of the initial
	perturbations as a function of various system parameters, the wave
	number, and the amplitude of the initial perturbation. As opposed
	to the linear theory then, both the neutrally stable state of the
	thin film and the dominant growth rate of the perturbations are functions
	of the amplitude of the perturbations. The time of rupture is derived
	for a thin film in contact with a solid and bounded by a thick bulk
	phase, with soluble surfactants present in both the film and the
	bounding fluid. The analytical expressions for a thin film devoid
	of surfactants are in good agreement with the numerical calculations
	of Williams and Davis for the same case. The nonlinear effects of
	the surfactant concentration driven Marangoni-motion (surface elasticity)
	and the surface shear viscosity are then considered. It is shown
	that for large initial perturbations, both the Marangoni-flow and
	the surface viscosity may prolong the time of rupture of a thin film
	by as much as a factor of 10, whereas the linear theory predicts
	this factor to be 4. Finally, the time of rupture of the mucus layer
	covering the corneal epithelium is derived and the effects of alterations
	in various characteristics of the external eye on the time of tear
	film breakup are studied. It is shown that large quantitative discrepancies
	exist between the time of tear film breakup computed by the linear
	and the nonlinear theories, if the amplitude of perturbations at
	the mucousaqueous interface is relatively large.},

  abstract = {We use a newly developed set of interface conditions to revisit the

	for the evaporation mass flux, we impose a more general equation
	expressing the balance of configurational momentum. This balance,
	which supplements the conventional conditions enforcing the balances
	of mass, momentum and energy on the film surface, arises from a consideration
	of configurational forces within a thermodynamical framework. We
	study the influence of two newly introduced terms on the evolution
	of the liquid film. One of these terms accounts for the transport
	of energy within the liquid\^{a}vapour interface. The other term,
	which we refer to as the effective pressure, accounts for vapour
	recoil. Both new terms are found to be stabilizing. Furthermore,
	the effective pressure is found to affect a time-dependent base state
	of the evaporating film and to be an important factor in applications
	involving liquid films with thicknesses of one or two monolayers.
	Specifically, we demonstrate that consideration of the effective
	pressure makes it possible to observe the influence of the van der
	Waals interactions on film evolution close to the instant of rupture.
	Dimensional considerations indicate that one of the most significant
	influences of these effects occurs for molten metals.},

	Previous work using linear theory has shown that the layer can become

	we shall study the nonlinear behaviour of this system to determine
	possible equilibrium waveforms for the instability when the critical
	point from the linear theory is slightly exceeded. We find that for
	all Prandtl numbers and small Biot numbers, possible waveforms are
	composed of only one of the unstable linear waves. For small Prandtl
	number and larger Biot numbers, a combination of the two linear waves
	is a possible waveform. Further analysis of these equilibrium states
	shows that both exhibit the Eckhaus and Benjamin-Feir sideband instability
	and a corresponding phase instability. Thus, they become modulated
	on long length-and timescales as the system develops.},

	for the interfacial profile, the streamwise component of the fluid
	velocity and the temperature variation along the surface. Initial
	temperature profiles change the initial flow field through Marangoni-induced
	shear stresses. These changes then lead to preferred conditions for
	rupture prescribed by the initial temperature distribution. We show
	that the time to rupture may be minimized by varying the phase difference
	between the initial velocity profile and the initial temperature
	profile. For sufficiently large temperature differences, the phase
	difference between the initial velocity and temperature profiles
	determines the rupture location.},

  abstract = {We discuss a thin film evolution equation for a wetting evaporating

	while wettability and capillarity play a major role. The model is
	first employed to study steady evaporating drops that are fed locally
	through the substrate. An asymptotic analysis focuses on the precursor
	film and the transition region towards the bulk drop and a numerical
	continuation of steady drops determines their fully non-linear profiles.
	Following this, we study the time evolution of freely evaporating
	drops without influx for several initial drop shapes. As a result
	we find that drops initially spread if their initial contact angle
	is larger than the apparent contact angle of large steady evaporating
	drops with influx. Otherwise they recede right from the beginning.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Surface-tension-driven Benard (Marangoni) convection in liquid
	layers heated from below can exhibit a long-wavelength primary instability
	that differs from the more familiar hexagonal instability associated
	with Benard. This long-wavelength instability is predicted to be
	significant in microgravity and for thin liquid layers. The instability
	is studied experimentally in terrestrial gravity for silicone oil
	layers 0.007 to 0.027 cm thick on a conducting plate. For shallow
	liquid depths (0.024 cm), the system forms only the hexagonal convection
	cells. A two-layer nonlinear theory is developed to account properly
	for the effect of deformation on the interface temperature profile.
	Experimental results for the long-wavelength instability are compared
	to our two-layer theory and to a one-layer theory that accounts for
	the upper gas layer solely with a heat transfer coefficient. The
	two-layer model better describes the onset of instability and also
	predicts the formation of localized elevations, which the one-layer
	model does not predict. A weakly nonlinear analysis shows that the
	bifurcation is subcritical. Solving for steady states of the system
	shows that the subcritical pitchfork bifurcation curve never turns
	over to a stable branch. Numerical simulations also predict a subcritical
	instability and yield long-wavelength states that qualitatively agree
	with the experiments. The observations agree with the onset prediction
	of the two-layer model, except for very thin liquid layers; this
	deviation from theory may arise from small non-uniformities in the
	experiment. Theoretical analysis shows that a small non-uniformity
	in heating produces a large steady-state deformation (seen in the
	experiment) that becomes more pronounced with increasing temperature
	difference across the liquid. This steady-state deformation becomes
	unstable to the long-wavelength instability at a smaller temperature
	difference than that at which the undeformed state becomes unstable
	in the absence of non-uniformity.},

  abstract = {An intriguing, dramatic and, at present, not fully understood instability
	often accompanies surfactant driven flows on thin films. This paper
	investigates a candidate mechanism that could create and drive this
	instability, van der Waals rupture, via numerical simulations coupled
	with analytical techniques. The spreading process itself is modelled
	with a pair of coupled evolution equations for the fluid film thickness
	and surfactant concentration that are derived in the lubrication
	approximation. These equations are then linearized about a base state
	that corresponds to the one-dimensional rupturing solution, and equations
	for the evolution of the transverse disturbances are derived. These
	linearized equations are investigated in several ways: numerical
	simulations where the perturbations are driven by the time evolving
	base state, or where the base state is frozen at a time tf close
	to the rupture event. The quasistatic initial value problem is also
	investigated as an eigenvalue problem, where the eigenvalue represents
	the quasistatic growth rate. We also take advantage of recent similarity
	scalings and results deduced for rupture, in the absence of surfactant,
	to motivate some of our numerical investigations. Additionally, we
	investigate the fully nonlinear equations including the transverse
	components. Perhaps interestingly, three-dimensional reconstructions
	of the film profile using the most dangerous mode from linear theory,
	as well as profiles from direct numerical simulations of the full
	nonlinear governing equations, that is, including interactions in
	the transverse direction, assume the form of finger-like patterns.

  volume = {23},
  pages = {114104+},

  abstract = {We focus on the early evolution of small (linear) perturbations following
	the sudden (step-function) exposure of a liquid layer to a cold adjacent
	atmosphere. On a time scale short relative to that characterizing
	thermal relaxation across the liquid layer, the temperature distribution
	is nonlinear and highly transient. Thus, the conduction reference
	state may not be regarded quasi steady. We accordingly consider the
	initial-value problem and obtain a Volterra-type integral equation
	governing the evolution of surface-temperature perturbations. Assuming
	an O(1) Biot number we study the effects on perturbations evolution
	of the wavenumber, the Prandtl number (Pr) and the effective Marangoni
	number (, which, from the dominant balance in the thermal perturbation
	equation, is based on the current values of the width of the thermal
	boundary layer and the temperature difference across it, respectively).
	Explicit results are first presented in the limit of Pr\&gt;\&gt;1
	wherein the hydrodynamic perturbation problem is quasi steady. The
	dominant perturbations correspond to large wavenumbers and convection
	effectively confined to the thermal boundary layer. Typical of the
	results is the nonmonotonic temporal evolution of perturbations which
	initially diminish and only after some finite delay time start to
	grow. These trends are rationalized in terms of the Marangoni mechanism
	by observing that while the magnitude of the reference-state temperature
	gradients remain essentially constant, they extend over a widening
	thermal boundary layer allowing for enhanced convective effects.
	Thus, since perturbations may be introduced at all positive times,
	those evolving on the favourable background of further developed
	(wider) thermal boundary layers may take over perturbations introduced
	earlier. This suggests the existence of a nonzero ” optimal” appearance
	time of perturbations which will eventually dominate the instability
	process. We study the effects of finite O(1) values of Pr on the
	evolution of the hydrodynamic perturbation problem which is no longer
	quasi steady. Increasing Pr at a constant is destabilizing which
	reflects the dual role of liquid viscosity in the transient {B\'{e}nard-Marangoni}
	problem. It is further demonstrated that with increasing wavenumber
	convergence to the asymptotic Pr\&gt;\&gt;1 limit is practically
	achieved at smaller Pr.},

  journal = {Physics of Fluids},
  year = {2010},
  volume = {22},
  pages = {022102+},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {In film coating and other applications involving thin liquid films,
	surfactants are typically employed to suppress the usually undesirable
	instabilities driven by surface phenomena. Yet, in the present study
	a mechanism of Marangoni instability in evaporating thin films is
	presented and analyzed, which has its origin on the effects of a
	soluble surfactant. As the film thins due to evaporation, thickness
	perturbations lead to surfactant concentration perturbations, which
	in turn drive film motion and tend to enhance uneven drying. A thin-film
	analysis is applied and evolution equations for the film thickness
	and the surfactant concentration are derived and analyzed by the
	techniques of linear stability and numerical simulation. In the linear
	analysis a nonautonomous system is obtained for the film thickness
	and surfactant concentration perturbations, which shows that the
	instability will manifest itself provided that an appropriate Marangoni
	number is relatively large and the surfactant solubility in the bulk
	is large as well. On the other hand, low solubility in the bulk,
	diffusion, and the effect of surfactant on interfacial mobility through
	the surface viscosity are found to suppress disturbance growth. Direct
	numerical simulations of the full nonlinear evolution equations confirm
	those results and add to the picture obtained for the physical system
	behavior. Estimates of the relevant dimensionless parameters suggest
	that the conditions for instability may be met in relatively thick
	films, on the order of tens of microns, for which the effects of
	molecular forces and disjoining pressure are not dominant. Moreover,
	the stabilizing effects of diffusion and interfacial mobility are
	not likely to become significant unless the films are much thinner,
	i.e., on the order of 1 μm or below.},

  abstract = {The instability and rupture of thin films due to a negative disjoining
	pressure is examined. A system of a thin film, bounded by a solid
	substrate and a second fluid phase semi-infinite in extent, is considered,
	and a nonlinear hydrodynamic stability analysis that takes into account
	the effects of the overlying fluid phase in a formal manner is presented.
	The analysis yields an evolution equation for the film thickness
	which reflects the effects of disjoining pressure and interfacial
	tension, as well as the dynamics of the two fluid phases. Limiting
	forms of the evolution equation are studied numerically to obtain
	qualitative features of the instability that cannot be captured by
	linear theory, and quantitative information about film rupture times.},

  abstract = {The thin liquid film at the contact line is gaining increasing attention
	due to its importance in phase-change heat transfer and wettability
	control. The intermolecular effects within the thin film are usually
	represented by of disjoining pressure. In the present work, molecular
	dynamics were employed to investigate the influence of disjoining
	pressure on thin–film evaporation and condensation in a nanoscale
	triple-phase system. The simulation domain was a cuboid with argon
	gas sandwiched between the two solid platinum walls. The two solid
	walls were fixed at the same temperature while the liquid films had
	different initial thicknesses thus corresponding to different disjoining
	pressures. Spontaneous evaporation and condensation were observed
	at the thicker and the thinner film, respectively. Disjoining pressure
	together with thermodynamics theories were employed to qualitatively
	and quantitatively explain the phenomenon. The evaporation fluxes
	were measured and compared to the {Hertz-Knudsen}-Schrage model which
	is based on the kinetic theory of gases. The resulting non-evaporating
	thickness was measured and compared to the models based on disjoining
	theory.},

  abstract = {The steady thermocapillary motion in a square cavity with a top free
	surface in the absence of gravitational forces is considered. The
	cavity is heated from the side with the vertical boundaries isothermal
	while the horizontal boundaries are adiabatic. The relative change
	in the surface tension is very small, i.e., an appropriate capillary
	number tends to zero, so that the free surface is assumed to remain
	flat at leading order. A finite‐difference method is employed to
	compute the flow field. Numerically accurate solutions are obtained
	for a range of Prandtl numbers and for Reynolds numbers Re as high
	as 5×104. Surface deflections are computed as a domain perturbation
	for small capillary number. In addition, asymptotic methods are used
	to infer the boundary layer structure in the cavity, in the limit
	of large values of the Reynolds and Marangoni numbers. For a fixed
	Prandtl number Pr, it is shown that the Nusselt number, liquid circulation,
	and maximum vorticity are asymptotic to Re1/3, Re−1/3, and Re2/3,
	respectively. These results are in agreement with the computed solutions.
	The leading‐order solution for the free‐surface deformation is sensitive
	to the value of Pr. With Pr\&gt;1, the depression near the hot corner
	may exceed the elevation near the cold corner, while a secondary
	elevation may be induced near the hot corner when Pr\&lt;1.},
